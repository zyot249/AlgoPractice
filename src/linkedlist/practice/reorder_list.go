Problem:
Ref: https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/description/

Given:
- You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:
- L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln

Return:
- Reorder the list to be on the following form:
- L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …

Constraints:
- You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.
- Length of list: [1, 5*10^4]
- Node value: [1, 1000]
*/

/*
First approach:
I use a pointer to traverse the list.
For each position, I use another pointer to find the last element in list and insert the last element between the element visited by the first pointer and its next element
If the last element is visited by first pointer, the algorithm will stop

Time complexity: O(n^2)
Space complexity: O(1)

		if curr == last {
			break

			temp := curr.Next
			curr.Next = last

Solution 1:
Add all node of list to array
Use 2 pointers to iterate the array from left and right side to form new list

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)

Use fast and slow pointers to find the middle of list
Reverse the second half and merge them together
